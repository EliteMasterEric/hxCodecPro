   * Set callbacks and private data to render decoded video to a custom area
   * in memory.
   * Use libvlc_video_set_format() or libvlc_video_set_format_callbacks()
   * to configure the decoded format.
   *
   * @warning Rendering video into custom memory buffers is considerably less
   * efficient than rendering in a custom window as normal.
   *
   * For optimal perfomances, VLC media player renders into a custom window, and
   * does not use this function and associated callbacks. It is <b>highly
   * recommended</b> that other LibVLC-based application do likewise.
   * To embed video in a window, use libvlc_media_player_set_xwindow() or
   * equivalent depending on the operating system.
   *
   * If window embedding does not fit the application use case, then a custom
   * LibVLC video output display plugin is required to maintain optimal video
   * rendering performances.
   *
   * The following limitations affect performance:
   * - Hardware video decoding acceleration will either be disabled completely,
   *   or require (relatively slow) copy from video/DSP memory to main memory.
   * - Sub-pictures (subtitles, on-screen display, etc.) must be blent into the
   *   main picture by the CPU instead of the GPU.
   * - Depending on the video format, pixel format conversion, picture scaling,
   *   cropping and/or picture re-orientation, must be performed by the CPU
   *   instead of the GPU.
   * - Memory copying is required between LibVLC reference picture buffers and
   *   application buffers (between lock and unlock callbacks).
   *
